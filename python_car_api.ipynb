When the front wheels are steered into a turn, the rear wheels slightly pivot in opposite phase (opposite direction of the front wheels) at lower vehicle speeds or same phase (same direction of the front wheels) at higher vehicle speeds. The opposite phase motion enables the car to make tighter turns than it otherwise could, while the same phase motion enhances the car's high speed stability.

Active Comfort Drive adjusts the suspension between firm and soft, adapting to the way in which the car is driven and whether the road is straight or curvy. The suspension is smoother when the car is driven straight and is firmed when the car is taken into curves, the firm setting reducing how much the car leans when cornering. Road Preview anticipates the type of suspension firmness required ahead by using data from the navigation system.

Active Comfort Drive adjusts the suspension between firm and soft, adapting to the way in which the car is driven and whether the road is straight or curvy. The suspension is smoother when the car is driven straight and is firmed when the car is taken into curves, the firm setting reducing how much the car leans when cornering. Road Preview anticipates the type of suspension firmness required ahead by using data from the navigation system. Active Comfort Drive draws from Road Preview's information and calibrates the suspension accordingly.; Black brake calipers</td>\n",

       "2  Integral Active Steering, which includes variable ratio front steering and rear wheel steering that turns in coordination with the front steering. When the front wheels are steered into a turn, the rear wheels slightly pivot in opposite phase (opposite direction of the front wheels) at lower vehicle speeds or same phase (same direction of the front wheels) at higher vehicle speeds. The opposite phase motion enables the car to make tighter turns than it otherwise could, while the same phase motion enhances the car's high speed stability. The amount of rear wheel steer varies, based on the angle the front wheels are steered.; Active Comfort Drive with Road Preview. Active Comfort Drive adjusts the suspension between firm and soft, adapting to the way in which the car is driven and whether the road is straight or curvy. The suspension is smoother when the car is driven straight and is firmed when the car is taken into curves, the firm setting reducing how much the car leans when cornering. Road Preview anticipates the type of suspension firmness required ahead by using data from the navigation system. Active Comfort Drive draws from Road Preview's information and calibrates the suspension accordingly.; Black brake calipers   \n",

The Stop & Go function will bring the 7 Series to a complete stop if the vehicle ahead stops. Upon application of the accelerator, Active Cruise Control allows the car to start moving again. Once there's no longer any nearby slower moving traffic ahead, the cruise control resumes the initial speed set by the driver.; Traffic Jam Assistant, which when activated and the driver has one or both hands on the steering wheel, will make small steering adjustments during low speed travel; Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance, the former keeping the car centered within a given lane and the latter making the car veer away from a vehicle that is drifting from either side of the 7 Series towards it.   \n",

Active Comfort Drive adjusts the suspension between firm and soft, adapting to the way in which the car is driven and whether the road is straight or curvy. The suspension is smoother when the car is driven straight and is firmed when the car is taken into curves, the firm setting reducing how much the car leans when cornering. Road Preview anticipates the type of suspension firmness required ahead by using data from the navigation system. Active Comfort Drive draws from Road Preview's information and calibrates the suspension accordingly.; Black brake calipers</td>\n",

At that time, the cruise control matches the speed of the 7 Series to that of the slower moving vehicle, maintaining a driver selected, pre-set distance between the two vehicles. The Stop &amp; Go function will bring the 7 Series to a complete stop if the vehicle ahead stops. Upon application of the accelerator, Active Cruise Control allows the car to start moving again. Once there's no longer any nearby slower moving traffic ahead, the cruise control resumes the initial speed set by the driver.; Traffic Jam Assistant, which when activated and the driver has one or both hands on the steering wheel, will make small steering adjustments during low speed travel; Active Lane Keeping Assistant with Side Collision Avoidance, the former keeping the car centered within a given lane and the latter making the car veer away from a vehicle that is drifting from either side of the 7 Series towards it.</td>\n",

       "2  Integral Active Steering, which includes variable ratio front steering and rear wheel steering that turns in coordination with the front steering. When the front wheels are steered into a turn, the rear wheels slightly pivot in opposite phase (opposite direction of the front wheels) at lower vehicle speeds or same phase (same direction of the front wheels) at higher vehicle speeds. The opposite phase motion enables the car to make tighter turns than it otherwise could, while the same phase motion enhances the car's high speed stability. The amount of rear wheel steer varies, based on the angle the front wheels are steered.; Active Comfort Drive with Road Preview. Active Comfort Drive adjusts the suspension between firm and soft, adapting to the way in which the car is driven and whether the road is straight or curvy. The suspension is smoother when the car is driven straight and is firmed when the car is taken into curves, the firm setting reducing how much the car leans when cornering. Road Preview anticipates the type of suspension firmness required ahead by using data from the navigation system. Active Comfort Drive draws from Road Preview's information and calibrates the suspension accordingly.; Black brake calipers   \n",

       "0  When engaged, Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go operates as normal cruise control until it senses a slower moving vehicle directly ahead. At that time, the cruise control matches the speed of the 7 Series to that of the slower moving vehicle, maintaining a driver selected, pre-set distance between the two vehicles. The Stop & Go function will bring the 7 Series to a complete stop if the vehicle ahead stops. Upon application of the accelerator, Active Cruise Control allows the car start moving again. Once there's no longer any nearby slower moving traffic ahead, the cruise control resumes initial speed set by the driver; Active Driving Assistant, which includes Forward Collision Warning, Pedestrian Warning, City Collision Mitigation and Lane Departure Warning, which when the car is moving at highway speeds, senses any course deviations that could cause the car to cross the road's lane markings while the turn signal is not in use. If such a deviation is identified, the driver is alerted with a vibration sent through the steering wheel. This feature can be deactivated by the driver.   \n",
